1. Using a CLI navigate to the folder where you have saved the application
2. Run command `node index.js` to start the application
3. Answer all question prompts
4. A new file titled `index.html` will be saved in the `dist` subfolder

To ensure proper display and formatting of the finished HTML file be sure to copy the `assets` subfolder to the same location you will be using the generated `index.html`

(Note: if you run the application after you have already generated an HTML file it will overwrite any previously generated file, be sure to move/copy `index.html` to another location before running the application again)
